<h1> Battleships the game </h1>


<h3> Breif </h3> 
During my time at CodeClan I wanted to push myself further than just the course work in learning both Javascript and problem 
solving in coding. 

To this I looked at creating one of the classic games BattleShip. I had thought this was initally straight forward but soon
realised that game logic and making the computer calculate something like co-ordinates took a lot of logic.

Although Battleships is a two player game, my goal was just to make a one player game where the player has to guess the computers
position.

<strong> MVP: </strong>

- Have computer randomise coordinates for a ship of a given length.
- Randomised coordinates should be just like the game, sequentianl vertically and horizontally.
- Screen should display a grid and be able to record both failed hits and succesful hits.
- Player should be able to see what ships are left to destroy.
